Verify your website with Pinterest and show pinners you're a trustworthy source!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to verify your website with Pinterest by inserting a meta tag on your front page (no coding required).

It simply outputs the verification meta tag for Pinterest to recognize your website as instructed at <http://business.pinterest.com/verify/>.

Now pinners will see the verification checkmark AND grant you access to Pinterest's free analytics!

That's all there is to it!
